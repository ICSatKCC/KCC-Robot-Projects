### Beginning With NAO
There are a lot you can do and learn with the NAO robots. Starting off, it's good to know [what you can say to NAO](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-8/family/nao_user_guide/basic_channel_conversation_nao.html).

Seeing what NAO is already capable of is a good starting point to see what you want to explore in your project.

### My Project
I was interested in exploring human - robot interactions and seeing how much NAO could recognize human emotions.  This all stemmed from the "Get Smile" behavior in Choregraphe.  I was interested in creating a robot that could help with people's mental health, so that if someone was looking sad, NAO would tell a joke to cheer them up.
