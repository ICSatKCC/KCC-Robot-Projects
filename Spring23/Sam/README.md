# Beginning With NAO
There are a lot you can do and learn with the NAO robots. Starting off, its fun to play around with getting to know NAO.
It's good to know [what you can say to NAO](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-8/family/nao_user_guide/basic_channel_conversation_nao.html).
Seeing what NAO is already capable of is a good starting point to see what you want to explore in your project.
