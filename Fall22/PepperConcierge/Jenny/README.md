### The Implementation and Development of a Semi-Humanoid Concierge Robot for the Stem Center
Duration: 08/22 - 12/22
Pepper, a semi-humanoid robot manufactured by SoftBank Robotics. Introduced in Tokyo 2014 as a concierge robot, it is available as a research and educational robot for schools, colleges and universities to teach programming and conduct research into human-robot interactions as well as noted uses in hospitals and hotels. 

## Purpose
The STEM Center at Kapi’olani Community College has reopened, with the use of the Pepper robot, the goal is to automate this process, especially the check in process, and assist with basic student STEM services and questions. 

## Methods
The materials used in this research project includes:

* 1 Pepper robot
* laptop with internet access 
* Robot Management System (cloud-based robot project development platform).

The methods employed includes several initial steps:

1. Assess the physical and software limitations of Pepper 

*side note: pepper cannot pickup anything with her hands. She cannot detect items in front of her. It's important to remove anything that she might bump into (give her atleast a 4ft radius of clear space). Fun trick: place your hand on the top of her head... she giggles!*

2. Become familiarize with the Robot Management System 
On the backend using the robot management system you can do the following to the display:

[ ] Map Kapi’olani CC campus

[ ] Hours, location, and staff of STEM Center

[ ] Check in sheet
-For this I used Google Forums, it's important to note that you need to remove permissions to allow everyone to access the link. Since the Pepper robot is conencted to a HAWAII.EDU account as well as the google forum, double check your permissions and test that it works.

## Problems Encountered
Further research and experimentation is needed to refine the practical uses of the Pepper robot with student interactions. If there is not internet access, poor lighting, or the user is wearing a mask the robot has a hard time picking up the commands from the user. Dialogue options can be done through the Robot management system BUT I could not find why when dialogue options were placed... it didn't work or prompt the robot...

## Resources
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. Wether it's been 3 months or 3 years from the duration of this project. I'm always happy to help! Feel free to view the poster I presented to SURF as well it's video below.
