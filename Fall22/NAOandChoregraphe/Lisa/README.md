### Getting Started 
Meet NAO, a humanoid robot, created by Softbank Robotics!

I recommend getting familiar with NAO first before programming it. The Softbank Robotics Documentation can be found [here.](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-8/getting_started/index.html)

(Note: The company was doing a restructuring this semester so by the time you are reading this, they might have a new website up.)

* After turning NAO on (by pressing the chest button), this [link](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-8/family/nao_user_guide/basic_channel_conversation_nao.html#bchannel-text-nao) contains everything you can say to NAO like asking NAO to sing "Mary had a little lamb."
