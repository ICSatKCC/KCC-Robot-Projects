# Write-Up

My project was fairly simple. I got my robot to function as a dance instructor, where it narrates itself doing the movements and offers encouragement to people following along. I only utilized the prebuilt actions found in Choregraphe, the software used to program NAO. These actions can be found on the left hand side box upon opening up Choregraphe. To start programming, you simply drag and drop these actions into the middle box and connect them. A connected sequence of these actions would be the program, which you then just run on the robot.   
  
To expand upon this project, I would recommend exploring the Timeline functionality. Timeline boxes can be found on the left hand side as well, but they function differently compared to the prebuilt ones. When you place a Timeline box into the middle area, you can then double click it to open up, as mentioned in the name, a timeline. From there, you can program your own actions for the robot to do by moving its limbs around, save those actions onto the timeline, and when you run the program the robot will carry out those actions. You can make NAO do all sorts of fancy things that aren't in the prebuilt section, like do push-ups or walk with its hands up like a zombie. I tried to explore timeline functionality at the end of the project but didn't really have time to implement it. If you are just starting and want to explore the movement aspects of the robot, I would recommend looking into timelines ASAP. 

Here's a link to some information about Timelines on the Aldebaran Robotics website. It's a good place to get a general idea of what they do:
