            <source>OHHH. We want it dark!. So you choose a black coffee; Black coffee is as simple as it gets with ground coffee beans steeped in hot water, served warm. And if you want to sound fancy, you can call black coffee by its proper name: cafe noir. Since it isn’t doctored up with milk or sugar, the quality of coffee is especially important. Treat yourself to a coffee subscription box to find your favorite style.</source>

            <source>Tomatoes contain the antioxidant lycopene, which may reduce the risk of prostate and other cancers. But vegetable juice contains many more healthy veggies than just tomatoes. That means it is rich in vitamins and minerals, and its fiber will help keep you feeling full for longer. Choose a variety that contains 100 percent vegetable juice and is low in sodium. Check the label to ensure the type you buy contains fiber since not all do.</source>

            <source>OHHH. We want it dark!. So you choose a black coffee; Black coffee is as simple as it gets with ground coffee beans steeped in hot water, served warm. And if you want to sound fancy, you can call black coffee by its proper name: cafe noir. Since it isn’t doctored up with milk or sugar, the quality of coffee is especially important. Treat yourself to a coffee subscription box to find your favorite style.</source>
