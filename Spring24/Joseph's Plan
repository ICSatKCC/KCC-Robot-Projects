SCI - 295CS

After looking through previous semesters projects, it gave me a cool understanding as well as a foundation for where to begin my 
thoughts and ideas. For one, with facial recognition, possibly we could code the robot to react differently depending on facial 
recognition, for example, it would react happily if the person was happy. Or maybe do something even more personalized such as if 
the person makes a sad face, it will do something to cheer them up, via possibly making the robot dance. Another one I thought of 
was having the robot be similar to Siri, in which it can answer basic questions and play music and such. With the growing knowledge 
of this course as well as my partners ideas I think we can make the robot do fun things!

Currently so far, I am installing the VM on my at home PC, because I know my current macbook would not support something that is 
so storage heavy. I have tested the VM and have “Oracle Linux (64 - bit)” installed within it. I am planning on adding the software 
to the VM soon. On my macbook, I have installed all the NAO 6 downloads, however I am experiencing a bit of trouble when opening the 
NAO setup because it needs me to give permission and I don’t know how.

Lastly, I think with the help of my new partners within the semester project we can definitely get a lot done and am looking forward 
to not only learning a new language in python, but also learning new skills in robotics!
