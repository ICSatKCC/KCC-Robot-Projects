My plan this semester is to get ROS working in my virtual machine. I would also like to hopefully write a program for the 
NAO bots so that they do something entertaining for surf. Other than that I want to learn more about how ROS works and 
the NAO botsfunctionality. I will hopefully get a visualizer working this semester so that I can work on my project
without needed to be in the same room as the robots.
