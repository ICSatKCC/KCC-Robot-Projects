ROS2 and the naoqi_driver2 are fully functional on the Dell laptop. These instructions are for starting ROS2 up and connecting to the NAO on that machine.

# Dell Laptop
- Press the F12 key to drop down the terminal (this terminal app is called Yakuake)

- make sure the terminal is in `~/ros2_humble` directory.
  ```
  cd ~/ros2_humble
  ```
- You will need probably 3 terminal windows/Shells. Press the `+` on the left side of the terminal lower bar to open more. Yakuake automatically opens new windows in the same director.
### Turn off NAO autonomous life via SSH
