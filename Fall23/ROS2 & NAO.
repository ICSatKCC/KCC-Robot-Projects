What I have learned thus far trying to get ROS2 working:
1)Getting ROS2 installed is super easy
2)Using ROS2 is a little more annoying to use as everytime you start up a terminal you have to source ROS2 before you can actually run any commands(but as soon as you 
open a terminal ros2 starts up so you dont have to create a workspace like ros1)
3)You can SSH to the NAO bots. Very cool.

What can you do once you are successfully SSH'd to NAO?
-If the NAO bot doesn't also have ROS2 installed on it then essentially nothing. Sorry :(

I have been attempting to fix this issue by installing ROS2 on the NAO bots. I was trying to do this by using the NAO's packet manager which should be, according to 
softbanks, called emerge. This is where I start having issues. Packet managers basically helps to install new packages and are, to my understanding, needed to get ROS2 onto 
NAO. If you are SSH'd onto NAO you can check which packet manager the robot has by using the comand 'which'(e.x.: which emerge). I keep getting the message: No emerge in. Which
means I am having many of issues trying to get ROS2 on NAO but I have requested backup(Lisa) abd hopefully all will be fixed soon. Will update.
